### Variables and Constants

1. Variables and constants are the basic data objects manipulated in a program.
2. All variables must be declared before use, although certain declarations can be made implicitly by content.

<br/>

> **[info] Primative Data Types**
>1. char &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **a single byte, capable of holding one character in the local character set**
>2. int &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **an integer, typically reflecting the natural size of integers on the host machine**
>3. float &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **single-precision floating point**
>4. double &nbsp;&nbsp; **double-precision floating point**

<br/>

> **[info] `signed` and `unsigned` forms**
>1. Unsigned &nbsp;&nbsp; **target type will have unsigned representation**
>   * Unsigned char: 0~255
>   * Signed char: -128~127
>   * The max unsigned integer is 2^31
>       * If add two unsigned integer larger than 2^31, it will overflow, results will be mod by 2^32
>   * The max signed integer is 2^32
>       * If add two signed integer larger than 2^31, it will overflow, results will be negative number
>2. Signed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **target type will have signed representation**

<br/>

> **[warning] String **
>1. String is not primative data type.
>2. String constants would be concatenated at compile time.
>3. C uses “array” of chars for storing a string.
>   * String must ends with a special character '\0'
>       * ```char str[] = { 'F', 'o', 'o', 'b', 'a', 'r', '\0' }```
>   * You would define a string like, in this way the NULL character is hidden
>       * ```char str[] = “Foobar”```
>   * You would use a char* “pointer”, in this way the NULL character is hidden
>       * ```char *str = “Foobar”```

<br/>

Certain characters can be represented in character and string constants by escape sequences.

<br/>

| Escape sequence | Character represented | Escape sequence | Character represented |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|      `\a`       |    alert character    |      `\\`       | backslash |
| `\b` | backspace | `\?` | question mark |
| `\f` | formfeed | `\'` | single quote |
| `\n` | newline | `\"` | double quote |
| `\r` | carriage return | `\ooo` | octal number |
| `\t` | horizontal tab | `\xhh` | hexadecimal number |
| `\v` | vertical tab |  |  |  |

### Operators and expressions

1. Arithmetic Operators
  * The binary arithmetic operators are addition `+`, subtraction, `-` multiplication `*`, division `/`, and the modulus operator `%`.
2. Relational and Logical Operators
  * The relational operators are `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `==`, and `!=`.
  * The logical operators are `&&` and `||`.
3. Increment and Decrement Operators
  * The increment operator `++` adds 1 to its operand, while the decrement operator `--` subtracts 1.
  * These operators can be placed before (prefix) or after (postfix) a variable.
4. Bitwise Operators
  * The bitwise operators are bitwise AND `&`, bitwise inclusive OR `|`, bitwise exclusive OR `^`, left shift `<<`, right shift `>>`, and one's complement `~`.
5. Assignment Operators and Expressions
  * The assignment operator `=` assigns a value to a variable.
6. Conditional Expressions
  * The conditional expression is `(condition_is_true) ? do_if_true : do_if_false;`.
  * In the expression `expr1 ? expr2 : expr3`, the expression `expr1` is evaluated first. If it is true, then the expression `expr2` is evaluated, and that is the value of the conditional expression. Otherwise `expr3` is evaluated, and that is the value. Only one of `expr2` and `expr3` is evaluated.
