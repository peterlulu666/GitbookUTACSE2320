### Pointer

1. Addresses in Memory
    * The address of the variable is stored in the memory.
    * We would use the address operator, an ampersand `&`, to return its address.
    * The format specifier for address is `%p`.
2. Number Systems

| Common Name | Base |      Digits      |
| :---------: | :--: | :--------------: |
|   binary    |  2   |        01        |
|    octal    |  8   |     01234567     |
|   decimal   |  10  |    0123456789    |
| hexadecimal |  16  | 0123456789ABCDEF |
3.Pointers
* A pointer is a variable whose contents are the
  address of another variable.
  Let's say that the integer is `int number = 3;` the content of `number` is 3
  and the address of number is `&number`. We would create a pointer
  `int *numberPtr;` and copy the address of number to the pointer `numberPtr = &number`. The content of `numberPtr` is
  the address of `number`.
* We would use the dereference operator,
  an asterisk `*`, to modify its locations in memory.
  Let's say that the integer is `int number = 3;` and
  the pointer is `int* numberPtr;`. We would copy the address of
  the number to the pointer `numberPtr = &number`. The content of number
  is `number`, which is 3. The content of number using pointer is `*numberPtr`, which is 3.
  We would change waht the pointer points to `*numberPtr = 6`.
  The content of number will be 6.
* Pointer `numberPtr` has its own type, a type of
  `int*` or pointer-to-int.
* We would increment the address in the pointer `numberPtr++`.
* Pointers to pointers
    * Pointers can contain the address of another pointer.
      `int number = 5;`, `int* numberPtr = &number`, `int** Ptr2 = &numberPtr;`.
* We would compare the addresses stored in
  pointers `if(numberPtr1 == numberPtr2)`.
* We would compare the values of the variables that
  pointers point to `if(*numberPtr1 == *numberPtr2)`.
* We would initialize the pointer to `NULL`, `int *numberPtr;`, `numberPtr = NULL`.

4.Pointers and Functions

Pointers allow us to use a process called *pass* by *reference*,
in which we will be able to change the value of the original variable.
We do this by passing the variable’s address to the function.

5.Arrays of Pointers

A pointer is a variable type and we can
have an array of pointers just as we have had arrays of other variable types.

<br/>
### Array

1. Array is a variable that can hold more than one value.
2. We would define an array of size 10 `int a[10]`.
    1. The array `a[10]` will hold 10 integer numbers.
    2. We could provide the specific array values `a[0] = 1`, `a[1] = 2`, etc.
    3. We would also declare and initialize the array at the same time `int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`.
3. The first element of the array is `a[0]`, the second element is `a[1]`, etc.

<br/>

> **[info] Array**
>* Each element of the array will be of the same type.
>* Array indices began at 0.
>* The initialized values will be at the beginning of the array.
>* The remaining values will be initialized to zero.

<br/>

> **[warning] Array out of bounds **
>* A common error is the “array out of bounds” error that occurs when the index goes beyond the declared size.
>* The value outside the assigned range will be changed.

<br/>

### Multidimensional Arrays

1. 2D array
    * `int a[rows][columns] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };`
2. 3D array
    * `int a[][][];`

> **[warning] 1D and 2D arrays differences **
><br/>
>When declaring a 2D array, the number of columns is required.

### Pointers and arrays

1.Pointers and arrays are closely linked in C.

```c
/*array name evaluates to the address of
 * the first element in the array*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    printf("The address of num[0] is %p\n", num);
    printf("The content of num[0] is %d\n", *num);

    return 0;
}
```
> **[info] Arrays**
<br/>
The array name `num` is the address of the first element,
   and `*num` is the content of the first element.
>


```c
/*array name evaluates to the address of
 * the first element in the array*/
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int* numPtr = num;
    int* firstPtr = &num[0];
    printf("The address of num[0] using numPtr is %p\n", numPtr);
    printf("The content of num[0] using numPtr is %d\n", *numPtr);
    printf("The address of num[0] using firstPtr is %p\n", firstPtr);
    printf("The content of num[0] using firstPtr is %d\n", *firstPtr);

    return 0;
}
```

> **[info] Pointers and arrays**
<br/>
Let's say that `firstPtr` is the pointer to
the integer `num[0]`, declared as `int* firstPtr;`.
1. `firstPtr = &num[0]` is the address of `num[0]`.
2. `*firstPtr` is the contents of `num[0]`.
>

2.We would increment the address to move through the array.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    printf("The address of num[1] is %p\n", num + 1);
    printf("The content of num[1] is %d\n", *(num + 1));

    return 0;
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int* numPtr = num;
    int* firstPtr = &num[0];
    printf("The address of num[1] using numPtr is %p\n", numPtr + 1);
    printf("The content of num[1] using numPtr is %d\n", *(numPtr + 1));
    printf("The address of num[1] using firstPtr is %p\n", firstPtr + 1);
    printf("The content of num[1] using firstPtr is %d\n", *(firstPtr + 1));

    for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
        printf("The address of num[%d] using firstPtr is %p\n", i, firstPtr + i);
        printf("The content of num[%d] using firstPtr is %d\n", i, *(firstPtr + i));
    }

    return 0;
}
```

> **[info] Pointer arithmetic**
<br/>
Let's say that `firstPtr` is the pointer to
the integer `num[0]`, declared as `int* firstPtr;`.
1. `firstPtr + i` is the address of `num[i]`.
2. `*(firstPtr + i)` is the contents of `num[i]`.
>

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char charArray[] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'};
    int intArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    printf("charArray       intArray\n");
    printf("------------------------------\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        printf("%p  %p\n", charArray + i, intArray + i);
    }


    return 0;
}
```

> **[info] Pointer arithmetic**
<br/>
Pointer arithmetic handles the task of determining the
address of the next element in the array.
>

3.Arrays and functions

> **[info] Arrays as function parameters**
* We would pass the address of the first
element of an array `int num[] = {1, 2, 3};` `function(num);`.
* The subscript style of
the array as function parameters `void function(int data[]){}`.
* The pointer style of
the array as function parameters `void somefunction(int* data){}`.
>

4.2D Arrays

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int data[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3},
                      {6, 7, 8}};
    printf("The address of data is %p\n", data);
    printf("The address of row 0 is %p\n", *data);
    printf("The value of the data[0][0] is %d\n", **data);

    return 0;
}
```

> **[info] 2D Arrays**
* Returning the address of any element of any row `*(array_name + row) + column`.
* Returning the value of any element of any row `*(*(array_name + row) + column)`.
>

5.Pointers to 2D arrays

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int data[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3},
                      {6, 7, 8}};
    int *ptrOne = &data[0][0];
    int (*ptrTwo)[3] = data;
    printf("The first element of array is %p\n", ptrOne);
    printf("The first element of array is %p\n", ptrTwo[0]);

    return 0;
}
```

> **[info] 2D Arrays**
* We can also create a pointer to a 2D array.
* The `int *ptrOne = &data[0][0];`
allows pointer arithmetic based on individual ints.
* The `int (*ptrTwo)[3] = data;`
allows pointer arithmetic based on row/column values for accessing the array elements.
>

6.We can have an array whose members are pointers.

7.The typical use for arrays of pointers is not with
numeric types, such as int or double, but with
strings.
