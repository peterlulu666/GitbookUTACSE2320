### `if` statement

The syntax is

<br/>

```
if (condition_is_true)
    do_something;
```

<br/>

Sometimes we wish to do more than one thing in response to a condition being true. We would use braces.

<br/>

```
if (condition_is_true){
    do_something;
    do_something;
}
```

<br/>

Sometimes we wish to have a second conditional statement in response to the first condition being true. It's a good idea to use braces when there are nested `if`s.

<br/>

```
if (condition_is_true)
    if(condition_is_true){
        do_something;
    }
```

<br/>

Sometimes we wish to do one thing if a condition is true but another if the condition is false.

<br/>

```
if (condition_is_true)
    do_something;
else
    do_something_else;
```

<br/>

### `else if` statement

What happens in the `else if` statement is that one of the statement is executed, depending on which of the condition is true. Each condition is tested in turn, and if one is true, the corresponding statement is executed, and the rest are skipped. if none of the condition is true, we fall through to the last one.

<br/>

The syntax is

<br/>

```
if (expression)
    statement
else if (expression)
    statement
else if (expression)
    statement
else if (expression)
    statement
else
    statement
```

<br/>

> **[info] `else if` statement**
><br/>
>This sequence of `if` statements is the most general way of writing a multi-way decision. The *expressions* are evaluated in order; if an *expression* is true, the *statement* associated with it is executed, and this terminates the whole chain. As always, the code for each *statement* is either a single statement, or a group of them in braces.

<br/>


### Conditional expressions

Instead of an `if else` statement, we can use the *conditional expression* operator:

<br/>

`(condition_is_true) ? do_if_true : do_if_false;`

<br/>

`a = (condition_is_true) ? b : c`

<br/>

### `switch` statement

An `if else` statement is used for binary decisions–those with two choices. Sometimes there are more than two choices.

<br/>

The switch statement is a multi-way decision that tests whether an expression matches one of a number of constant integer values, and branches accordingly.

<br/>

```
switch (expression) {
    case const-expr: statements
    case const-expr: statements
    default: statements
}
```

<br/>

> **[warning] Notes on the use of the switch statement **
>1. The labels must be integers.
>2. The `default` line is optional.
>3. Once the matching label is found, that statement and each following statement will be executed.

<br/>


### Loops

1.`while` loops

There are many occasions in which we don’t know in advance how many times the loop should repeat, but we do know under what conditions the loop should terminate.

<br/>

```
while(test) {
    do_something;
}
```

<br/>

2.`for` loops

```
for(expression1; expression2; expression3)
    do_something;
```

<br/>

> **[info] expression**
>1. `expression1` initializes the counter.
>2. `expression2` is the condition for stopping.
>3. `expression3` is the method of incrementing the counter at
the end of the loop.

<br/>

3.`do-while` loops

The `do while` loop differs from the `while` loop in that the body will be visited once before the test is evaluated.

```
do
{
    do_something;
}
while(test)
```

<br/>

4.`continue` and `break`

We would use `continue` to jump to the very end of the current loop.

<br/>

We would use `break` to jump out of the current loop completely.
